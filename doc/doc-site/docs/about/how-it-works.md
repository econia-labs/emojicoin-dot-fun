## Bonding Curve Enabled Launchpad

When a new emojicoin launches, its pricing
mechanics are defined as an abridged Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market
Maker (CLAMM) with a single price range. Once the market cap of the emojicoin
reaches 45,000 APT value, the money used to purchase the coin by traders is
deployed to an emojicoin AMM pool.

## Emojicoin or Else

The only coins that can be launched are emojicoins that are from the
standardized [Unicode emoji library].

## Emojicoin AMM Pool

The emojicoin AMM follows the popular and standardized Uniswap v2 design.

## Life Cycle of Emojicoin: Launchpad to Pool

**Introduction**: Congratulations! You've decided to take on the daring journey
of parenthood and give birth to a beautiful emojicoin. Econia is your favorite
protocol on the Aptos blockchain, so you decide to name your fictional baby
emojicoin after her.

Unlike birthing a human child, giving birth to your beautiful Econia emojicoin
is painless and cheap by leveraging the Aptos blockchain. We'll now walk you
through your emojicoin's lifecycle.

### First Baby Steps: Launch your emojicoin

- With just 1 APT, you can launch your emojicoin — We don't believe in screwing
  over new parents with expensive medical bills.

### Growing Up: Exiting the Bonding Curve

- Emojicoins are like just like humans, as they grow up and mature they want to
  leave the house to take the world on their own.
- The emojicoin.fun platform utilizes a bonding curve for initial price
  discovery to take place. - The bonding curve is essentially an emojicoin's
  home. The way your emojicoin matures is depicted by the size of its market
  cap.
- The market cap size required to leave the bonding curve = 45,000 APT.
  For the emojicoin to reach a 45,000 APT market cap, it must have a net
  buy/sell pressure of +10,000 APT.

### Going to College: Emojicoin Liquidity Pools

- Once your emojicoin reaches a 45,000 APT market cap size, the coin's market
  experiences a 'state change' — The 10,000 APT used to purchase the coin is
  deposited into an emojicoin AMM Liquidity Pool, alongside 23% of the emojicoin
  token supply. This 'state change' is like your emojicoin baby now going to
  college and joining a sorority. This Liquidity Pool is locked and its LP
  tokens to represent it are burned — it can never be removed.
- The emojicoin in this LP is now available for users to liquidity farm, and
  of course still be available for trading.

We understand watching your child grow up is bittersweet, but it's a natural
part of life and you should be proud of what you've accomplished (like breaking
out of the bonding curve)!
