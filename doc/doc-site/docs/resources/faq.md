*Please note this is not financial advice and nothing the emojicoin monkey says
should be taken seriously. He just likes to listen to himself talk and has
caught the emojicoin bug.*

**Q: If an Emojicoin market is already launched, can I launch a second one of the same Emoji?**

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

A:  No, once a particular Emojicoin trading pair is launched, you cannot launch
another. You should potentially explore launching Emojicoin combinations
instead. Get creative, don't be lame.

**Q: Are emojicoins the future?**

A: Emojis are a universal language, transcending borders and languages. 🌍 With
the rise of decentralized finance and the integration of emojicoins, I believe
will see a global shift where emojicoins become the standard for transactions.
So get ready to live, laugh, and love with emojicoins! They're not just a
trend; they're a revolution. Embrace the future, where every transaction is a
smile, a laugh, and a story. Emojicoins are here to stay, and they're going
to change the world one emoji at a time. 🌈🚀💖
