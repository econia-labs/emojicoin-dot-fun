# SDK example

In order to both simplify the building of backend infrastructure like APIs and
indexing, and also allow third parties to build on top of our project, we want
to design a good SDK for the package we deploy.

Here, we created a minimal SDK to use with the example indexer.

This minimal example contains the core types, as well as useful utility
functions used in the indexer.

Ideally, more complete utility functions would be added, to cover most
usecases.
