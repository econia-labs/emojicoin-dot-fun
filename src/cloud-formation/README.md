# Indexer on CloudFormation

The indexer can be automatically deployed on [AWS CloudFormation] with [GitSync]
using the [template file] at `indexer.cfn.yaml` and an environment-specific
[stack deployment file] at `deploy-indexer-*.yaml`. Once a [stack] is configured
accordingly, `git` updates will result in automatic updates.

The indexer provides a public REST endpoint and a public WebSocket endpoint
under a root domain you provide, for an environment name of your choosing:

| Endpoint  | URI                                         | Hardening   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| REST      | `https://<ENVIRONMENT>.<YOUR_ROOT_DOMAIN>`  | API key     |
| WebSocket | `wss://ws.<ENVIRONMENT>.<YOUR_ROOT_DOMAIN>` | Forthcoming |

## Template parameters

`indexer.cfn.yaml` contains assorted [parameters] of the form `Deploy*` that can
be used to [conditionally][conditions] provision and de-provision [resources].
For a concise list of such parameters, see a [stack deployment file] at
`deploy-indexer-*.yaml`. See the template [rules] section for associated
dependencies.

Note that the `Environment` parameter should be unique across stacks, as it is
used for endpoint subdomain assignment.

## VPC stack abstraction

The indexer depends on an abstracted [VPC stack](#vpc-stack) with common
resources that can be shared across indexer deployments. Once you've deployed
a single VPC stack based on the [template file] at `vpc.cfn.yaml` and
the [stack deployment file] at `deploy-vpc.yaml`, you can re-use it across
indexer deployments.

## Setup

1. [Make Route 53 the DNS service for a domain you own], which will
   automatically be configured with a subdomain for each deployment environment.

1. Create the following [Secrets Manager secrets]:

   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

   <!--
   Markdown doesn't support in-row breaking, so use HTML and add an extra line
   in between tags as needed in order to use embedded Markdown syntax.
   -->

   <table><tr><th>
    Secret name
    </th><th>
    Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>

   `ecr-pullthroughcache/emojicoin/docker-hub`

   </td><td>

   See the `Docker Hub` section of [the upstream repository credentials docs].

   </td></tr><tr><td>

   `emojicoin/grpc-auth-token`

   </td><td>

   A plaintext API key for the [transaction stream service endpoint] you are
   connecting to, for example an
   [Aptos Labs transaction stream service API key]. Note that you'll need to
   prepend `https://` as applicable if it is a public endpoint, for example
   `https://grpc.devnet.aptoslabs.com:443`

   </td></tr></table>

1. Follow the `For Docker Hub` section of the
   [ECR pull through cache rule creation docs] using the secret
   `ecr-pullthroughcache/emojicoin/docker-hub` and prefix `emojicoin`.

   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

1. Create the following [Systems Manager parameters] with
   [fully-qualified names][parameter naming constraints], using `kebab-case` for
   consistency with the naming requirements for the
   [Docker Hub secret][the upstream repository credentials docs]:

   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

   <table><tr><th>

   [Aptos Labs gRPC endpoint].

   </td></tr><tr><td>

   `/emojicoin/indexer-dns-name/hosted-zone-id`

   </td><td>

   The [hosted zone ID] for your domain.

   </td></tr><tr><td>

   `/emojicoin/indexer-dns-name/root-domain`

   </td><td>
   The root domain you own.

   </td></tr><tr><td>

   `/emojicoin/minimum-starting-version/<mainnet|testnet|devnet>`

   </td><td>
    A transaction version number prior to the version in which the target Move
    package was published.

    The address of the Move package you want to index.
    </td></tr></table>

   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

   > Substitute either `mainnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet` for
   > `<mainnet|testnet|devnet>` depending on the network you want to index
   > (create a parameter for each network if you want to run deployments for
   > all).

1. Create the following [IAM roles]:

   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

   <table><tr><th>
    Role name
    </th><th>
    Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>

   `CloudFormationGitHubSync`

   `CloudFormationPowerUser`

   </td><td>

   A [CloudFormation service role] with [PowerUserAccess] plus the below

           "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile",
           "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
           "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",

       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   </details>
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

1. If you haven't already deployed a VPC stack, create a [stack deployment file]
   based on `deploy-vpc.yml`.

1. Create a [stack deployment file] (see `deploy-indexer-*.yml`) with
   appropriate [template parameters](#template-parameters) for the indexer (in
   particular the `Environment` parameter should be
   [unique across stacks](#template-parameters)).

1. If you haven't already deployed a VPC stack, [create the stack with GitSync],
   then monitor [GitSync events][gitsync event] in the
   [GitSync status dashboard] or with [`rain`]. After it has deployed, repeat
   for the indexer.

   > Use concise stack names like `emoji-vpc` and `emoji-production` since
   > excessively long names may result in resource creation failure due to
   > character count limits, for example the
   > [load balancer target group name 32 character limit].

## Querying endpoints

### Public endpoints

Once you have [deployed an indexer stack](#setup), query the public endpoint for
your deployment environment:

1. Set your stack name:

   ```sh
   STACK_NAME=<STACK_NAME>
   echo $STACK_NAME
   ```

1. Get the REST API key ID:

   ```sh
   API_KEY_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources \
       --logical-resource-id RestApiKey \
       --output text \
       --query 'StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId' \
       --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
   )
   echo $API_KEY_ID
   ```

1. Get the REST API key:

   ```sh
   API_KEY=$(aws apigateway get-api-key \
       --api-key $API_KEY_ID \
       --include-value \
       --output text \
       --query 'value'
   )
   echo $API_KEY
   ```

1. Get the endpoints specified in the [template outputs section]:

   ```sh
   REST_ENDPOINT=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --output text \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`RestEndpoint`].OutputValue' \
       --stack-name $STACK_NAME
   )
   WS_ENDPOINT=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --output text \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`WsEndpoint`].OutputValue' \
       --stack-name $STACK_NAME
   )
   echo $REST_ENDPOINT
   echo $WS_ENDPOINT
   ```

1. Wait until the DNS names have resolved:

   ```sh
   host $(echo $REST_ENDPOINT | sed 's|^.*//||')
   host $(echo $WS_ENDPOINT | sed 's|^.*//||')
   ```

1. Query the REST endpoint:

   ```sh
   curl -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
       "$REST_ENDPOINT/processor_status?select=last_success_version"
   ```

1. Connect to the WebSocket endpoint:

   ```sh
   websocat $WS_ENDPOINT
   ```

1. Subscribe to all events:

   ```sh
   {}
   ```

### Bastion host connections

Before you try connecting to the [bastion host][connect to a bastion host],
verify that the `DeployBastionHost` [condition][conditions] evaluates to `true`.
Note too that if you have been provisioning and de-provisioning other resources,
you might want to de-provision then provision the bastion host before running
the below commands, in order to refresh the bastion host [user data] that stores
the URLs of other resources in the stack.

1. Install the [EC2 Instance Connect CLI]:

   ```sh
   pip install ec2instanceconnectcli
   ```

1. Set your stack name:

   ```sh
   STACK_NAME=<STACK_NAME>
   echo $STACK_NAME
   ```

1. Connect to the bastion host over the [EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint]:

   ```sh
   INSTANCE_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --output text \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`BastionHostId`].OutputValue' \
       --stack-name $STACK_NAME
   )
   if [ -n "$(echo -e "${INSTANCE_ID}" | tr -d '[:space:]')" ]; then
   echo "Connecting to instance ${INSTANCE_ID}"
   aws ec2-instance-connect ssh \
       --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID --connection-type eice
   else
   echo 'Error: instance ID not found or is empty.' >&2
   fi
   ```

1. Start `psql`:

   ```sh
   psql $DB_URL
   ```

1. List the databases:

   ```sh
   \list
   ```

1. After exiting `psql`, to view WebSocket events published by the processor:

   ```sh
   websocat $PROCESSOR_WS_URL
   ```

1. Subscribe to all events:

   ```sh
   {}
   ```

1. Connect to the broker:

   ```sh
   websocat $BROKER_WS_URL
   ```

1. Subscribe to all events:

   ```sh
   {}
   ```

1. Query PostgREST:

   ```sh
   curl $POSTGREST_URL/processor_status?select=last_success_version && echo
   ```

1. Check PostgREST through the NLB:

   ```sh
   curl http://$NLB_DNS_NAME:3000/processor_status?select=last_success_version \
       && echo
   ```

## Design notes

### VPC stack

The indexer uses
[NAT gateways to provide internet access for private instances], with
[a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone][az-specific nat gateways] to ensure
high resilience. To avoid [VPC quota] exhaustion for multiple indexer
deployments, networking resources associated with the indexer are thus
abstracted into a [VPC]-specific [stack template][template file] at
`vpc.cfn.yaml`, whose resources can be re-used across multiple indexer
deployments via [cross-stack references].

Similarly, the VPC stack contains a single [EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint] that
can be used to [connect to a bastion host] for an indexer deployment inside the
VPC. This approach avoids [EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint quota] exhaustion.

Though not strictly necessary to prevent quota exhaustion, the following
common network resources are additionally abstracted:

1. A [DB subnet group].
1. A [private DNS namespace].

The VPC stack contains a [private and public subnet] for each
[Availability Zone] (AZ), with each public subnet sharing a common
[public internet route] inside a [custom route table]. Per
[AZ-specific NAT gateway best practices][az-specific nat gateways], each private
subnet has its own custom route table with a [NAT gateway route]. No additional
routing is required to enable communication across subnets, because as per the
[AWS routes docs]:

> Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC.
> This route is added by default to all route tables. If your VPC has more than
> one IPv4 CIDR block, your route tables contain a local route for each IPv4
> CIDR block.

The VPC uses an [AWS-recommended VPC CIDR block] of `10.0.0.0/16` corresponding
to 65,536 IP addresses, with each non-overlapping [subnet CIDR block] using a
`/19` netmask for up to 8,192 IP addresses per subnet (excluding the
[5 default reserved addresses per subnet]).

### Database

The indexer database uses [Aurora PostgreSQL] on a
[Multi-AZ Aurora Serverless v2 cluster] with a
[primary (writer) instance][aurora clusters] and a fallback
[replica (reader) instance][aurora clusters] in
[dynamically-assigned][auto-selection of aurora az], separate
[Availability Zones][aurora availability zones] to ensure
[high availability][high availability for aurora] with
[fault tolerant replica promotion] and [autoscaling][aurora autoscaling].

### Permissions

The `ContainerRole` [ECS task execution IAM role] provides
[least-privilege permissions] required for
[using an ECR pull through cache][ecr pull through cache permissions],
[container logging][container logging permissions], and accessing
[deployment secrets](#setup), with a
[wildcard resource][iam policy resource element] for
[`ecr::GetAuthorizationToken`] only, since it does not
[specify an action for an individual resource][iam policy resource element].
It also includes the [AmazonEC2ContainerServiceAutoscaleRole], which is required
for [application autoscaling IAM access].

For ease of accessing the various services required to deploy the indexer,
[`CloudFormationPowerUser`](#setup) is more permissive, though notably it
restricts [role passing] to the `ContainerRole`.

### Endpoint hardening

The `Waf` [resource][resources] specifies a [Web Application Firewall] to
protect REST and WebSocket endpoints, using custom and [managed rules]. The
`EnableWafRules*` [template parameters](#template-parameters) can be used to
toggle [rule actions] between `Block` and `Count`.

See the [Web ACL traffic overview dashboards] to monitor rules.

### Container scaling

[Container autoscaling] for both REST and WebSocket endpoints relies on a
mixture of [target tracking] for scaling out and [step scaling] for scaling in.

Scaling in uses a custom [step scale CloudWatch alarm] that only fires when more
than one instance is active, to prevent alarms from triggering when only one
instance is live and at idle.

This design ensures that at least one server container is always live for both
REST and WebSocket endpoints.
