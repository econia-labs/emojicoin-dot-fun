    # In order to start the node with the indexer API; i.e., run
    # `aptos node run-local-testnet --with-indexer-api`, the Docker socket must
    # be mounted to the container. This mount enables the container to start a
    # new container. Note that this is *not* 'Docker-in-Docker', but rather
    # 'Docker-outside-Docker'. That is, the container can act as the host in
    # terms of creating and orchestrating other containers but still appears as
    # a sibling to the existing containers and any new containers it creates.
