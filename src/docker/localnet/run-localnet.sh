# Note that the `--bind-to 0.0.0.0` flag is required to undo the default CLI
# behavior of binding to 127.0.0.1 since `aptos` v2.3.2.
# This is because the CLI is assumed to not be running inside a container, and
# issues can arise on Windows when binding to 0.0.0.0.
# See: https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/commit/d8eef35
