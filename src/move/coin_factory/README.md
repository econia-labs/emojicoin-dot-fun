# Coin factory

This package contains a minimal module for defining an emojicoin type as well
as the type for an associated LP coin. The `publish_and_spit.py` script can be
used to verify the package bytecode, and to delimit it as needed for publication
during runtime.

The resulting bytecode can then be included in the `emojicoin_dot_fun` package
as needed for dynamic coin type publication.
