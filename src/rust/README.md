## `emojicoin-dot-fun` indexer

### AWS CloudFormation

The indexer is deployed using [AWS CloudFormation] with a [template file] at
`cloud-formation/indexer.cfm.yaml` and a development-specific
[stack deployment file] at `cloud-formation/deploy-dev.yaml`.

By granting [PowerUserAccess] to the stack, deployments can be performed
programmatically using [GitSync] alone.

### Running Docker compose locally

1. Copy `example.env` to `.env`, which is ignored by `git`:

   ```sh
   cp example.env .env
   ```

1. Provide a `GRPC_AUTH_TOKEN` in your `.env` as described in `example.env`.

1. Modify other values as needed.

1. Start the indexer:

   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
