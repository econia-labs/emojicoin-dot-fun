# Emojicoin Frontend

## Building

### For production

pnpm run build
```

### To run the production app

```bash
pnpm run start --port 3001
```

We use `--port 3001` as an example here. You can use whatever you want, but generally the `postgrest` api occupies `port 3000`.

This project uses [`next/font`].
